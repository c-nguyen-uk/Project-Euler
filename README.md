# Project Euler
*Completed solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems (as I complete them).*

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is an archive of maths/programming problem-solving questions. Any code needs to run within one minute to really count as a satisfactory solution. To ensure this, all solutions will end with the following syntax.

```Python
# Prints the solution and ensures that it completes within 1 minute.

start = timeit.default_timer()
print(solution_function)
stop = timeit.default_timer()
print("Time:", stop - start)
```

Problems can be solved with or without code, and using any tools (such as Excel). My motivation behind doing Project Euler is to sharpen my problem-solving skills in Python, so my solutions will be code-centric.

Note that it is forbidden to post solutions to problems after 100.
