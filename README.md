# Project Euler
*Completed solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems (as I complete them).*

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is an archive of maths/programming problem-solving questions. Any code needs to run within one minute to really count as a satisfactory solution. To test for this, solutions will be decorated with the `computation_time()` decorator in [custom_timer.py](custom_timer.py):

```Python
from custom_timer import computation_time


@computation_time
def solution(...):
    ...


print(solution(...))
```

Problems can be solved with or without code, and using any tools (such as Excel). My motivation behind doing Project Euler is to sharpen my problem-solving skills in Python, so my solutions will be code-centric.

Note that it is forbidden to post solutions to problems after 100.
